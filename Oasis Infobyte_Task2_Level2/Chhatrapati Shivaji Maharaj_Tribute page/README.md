# Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj
Indian history’s one of the bravest and enlightened rulers, Chatrapati Shivaji is a legend for all times. His stupendous achievements carved him a unique place in the annals of this nation. The feats he could show to the world in terms of warfare, administration and nation building were phenomenal which few could replicate. Chatrapati Shivaji was a visionary who dreamt of a broad and wide Hindu nation that would also proclaim tolerance and comradeship in a tall manner. Here are a few quotes of Shivaji Maharaj which can inspire anyone with the ideals he stood for in his life.
Tolerance and duties of a ruler
“If a tree, which is not a highly elevated living entity, can be so tolerant and merciful to give sweet mangoes even when hit by anyone; being a king, should I not be more merciful and tolerant than the tree?”
Here Shivaji stresses on the importance of a ruler demonstrating tolerance and responsibility towards his subjects. Once a stone thrown by an old woman at a tree to fetch a mango accidentally hit Shivaji and he forgave her and rewarded her with the wealth that would support her to the rest of her life.

That is why he is our idol and to whome we admire the most.
